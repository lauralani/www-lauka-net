    Hi, my name is
    <strong>
        <span class="p-name">Laura
                Kalb</span>
    </strong>
    and I (literally) do things on the internet.
</p>
<h2>About me</h2>
<p class="p-note">
    I'm a network engineer, with a pretty mixed technical background. I started my career in software development, and then
    moved on to be a sysadmin with main emphasis on linux environments. Afterwards, I was a mix of network engineer and site
    reliability engineer. Now I'm responsible for the network infrastructure at a big datacenter provider.
</p>
<h2>Books</h2>
<p class="p-note">
    I always loved to read as many books as I can. So here I'm listing the books I've read since I started this webpage, 
    including a rating and short description. These are the last few books I've rated:
</p>
<ul>
{%- for book in collections.book | reverse -%}
    {% if loop.index0 < 5 %}
  <li><a href="{{ book.url }}">{{ book.data.name }}</a>   
          {% for i in range(0, book.data.rating) -%}
                ‚≠ê
        {%- endfor %}
  </li>
    {% endif %}
{%- endfor -%}
  <li><a href="/books/">more ...</a></li>
</ul>
